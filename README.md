How do I approach designing software? For me designing software is one bite at a time, the entire application looks increadibly daunting when you look at the whole mass of it. But breaking it up into smaller and smaller pieces is not only good design, but also much more approachable and sustainable. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? I've never worked in artisictic 3d spaces before with code. So honestly the entire project was increadibly useful for developing new skills. I'd say almost everything in the course was new material that had not been previouusly applied in a practical setting.

What design process did you follow for your project work? I following the design process of tackling small pieces every week. Even within the own weekly checkpoints the tasks could be broken into smaller pieces. For instance the AC box contianed in the scene was one entitiy, and then adding the vents and dials too it was another design session.


How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? I think the modular approach of this project visually, is very useful for breaking up future projects. This project had very visual feedback on when you made changes, but also visual troubleshooting as the code might compile and run, but not reach the desired outcome you were hoping for.


How do I approach developing programs? Again any complicated design I think is best approached by modular division of each process. If you've seen Ocean's 11, you're not doing a heist, you're doing a bunch of small jobs that build towards eventually getting a successful heist.


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?I used the strategy of just a lot of AB testing. Make a small change, compile the code, and see what it looks like. The very visual and aestehtic nature of the material caused a lot of revisions, and small changes to make it look right.

How did iteration factor into your development? I would say iteration gradually got easier over time, you become much more familiar with the code you're using. How to edit certain details of the scene like position, was more complicated in the beginning of development, but as you add multiple elements this part was so much smaller in later development. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? I think my approach was relatively consistent throughout the project, I wanted to continue chipping away at it week after week, and this didn't change from start to finish. Making changes to particular files in the code became a lot of intuitve and natural thoroughout development as I got more comfortable with OpenGl.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? I use computer science daily at this point, my job requires code and general computer science principles, so it helps me in all my professional goals. There's also just a ton of flexibility awarded to having a good understanding of computer science. I'm presented with constant opprotunities also through computer science, in the form of coworkers asking me to join on personal projects, to friends talking about making little scripts for our D&D sessions.


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? I think the integration of exisiting libraries and open source resources to this project was increadibly insightful and practical. Open sourcing a plastic material took a long time to figure out, but pulling upon and using pre exisiting material like this can easily be applied to other projects.


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? Similarly I think open source utilization has great function in professional settings. I use open source materials all the time at work, Iperf3 is an example, the modern business world also uses a bunch of linux systems as they are abundant with solutions and open source, similar to some of the materials utilized in this course.
